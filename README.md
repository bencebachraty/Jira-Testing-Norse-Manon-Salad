# Jira Testing Project - Norse Manon Salad

## Instructions for Sprint #3 - Refactor: Improve your solutions

### Project Overview
* This project takes several weeks to complete
* Through this testing project you learn to analize and test a yet unknown software
* Learn how to report bugs
* Design and implement manual testcases for functions
* Automate and run manual testcases

### This Sprint's Focus: Improving and Stabilizing Automated Tests
* Refactor your automation project with the new strategies
  * Data-Driven: Make the same test multiple times based on an input file, eg. log in with multiple users
  * Keyword-Driven: Organize functionalities to keywords, so that you can reuse them multiple times if needed
  * Page Object Model: Apply Page Object Model
 
### Expectations
* Code must be well organized and structured
* Find a balance between reusability and complexity
  * Aim to create easy to understand but still reusable keywords/testcases
* Tests should give the same result as last week (refactor should not effect the result, but the quality)
