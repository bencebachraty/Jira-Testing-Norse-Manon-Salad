# Jira Testing Project - Norse Manon Salad

## Week 6 - TW - Refactor: Improve your solutions

### Project Overview
* This project takes more weeks to complete
* Through this testing project you learn to analize and test a yet unknown software
* Learn to report Bugs
* Design and implement manual testcases for functions
* Automate and run manual testcases

### Sprint #3 - Improving and Stabilize Automated Tests
* Refactor your last week automation project with the new strategies
  * Data-Driven: Make the same test multiple times based on an input file eg: Log in with multiple users
  * Keyword-Driven: Organize functionalities to Keywords, so that you can reuse them multiple times if needed
  * Page Object Model: Apply Page Object Model
 
### Expectations
* Code must be well organized and structured
* Find balance between Reusability and Complexity
  * the aim to create easy to understand, still reusable keywords/testcases
* Tests should give the same result as last week (Refactor should not effect the result, but the quality)
